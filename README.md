## “理想与孤独。”
His name is "Xu Tianze".

However, he'd perfer his Nick name "天泽龟(Tianze Jun / Amasawa Kun)", which is a tricky homophonic pun.

He is a Ph.D. student in **BUPT(Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications)**, majoring in E-commerce & Law. 

By the way, his avatar is CMS from Girls' Frontline. It's from PID: 69147429。
