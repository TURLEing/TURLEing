His name is "Xu Tianze".

However, he'd perfer his Nick name "天泽龟(Tianze-san)", which is a tricky homophonic pun, and should be fined.

He is an undergraduated student from **BUPT(Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications)**, majoring in E-commerce & Law. 

- He used to be an OIer and a member of ACM Team, however, he is too poor to get any reward. He believe that in one day AI will replace all of us.
- He used to be the president of BUPT "Yanfeng" Anime Club, however, he is just a nerd and do nothing special. He just loves ACGN and that's it.

By the way, his avatar is CMS from Girls' Frontline. It's from PID: 69147429。
